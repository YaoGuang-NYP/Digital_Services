Needs an installation of wkHTMLtoPDF at : https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html, and then install it at C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf. Also needs the 'pdfkit' and 'beautifulsoup4' modules that you can find in Pycharm. Both of these needed in order for 'Download to PDF' function to work. Else, use the fallback version at branch.
